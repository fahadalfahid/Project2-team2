# EE413-Group2
This Repository made to submit Group 2 project 2 for course 413

Project Title:
Image Compression and Classification with Deep Learning

Course:
EE 413 â€“ Applied Digital Signal Processing
Spring 2025 (242), King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals

Instructor:
Dr. Abdullah F. Al-Battal

This project, part of the EE 413: Applied Digital Signal Processing course, focuses on exploring the interplay between image compression and classification using deep learning techniques. Students work in teams to implement wavelet-based image compression and compressed sensing on the Mini-ImageNet dataset, and assess their effects on the performance of pre-trained classification models such as ResNet or MobileNet. The project involves fine-tuning models on both original and compressed images, analyzing robustness, and evaluating classification accuracy across different compression levels. Students also gain hands-on experience with PyTorch, wavelet transforms, convex optimization, and GitHub-based collaboration, culminating in a technical presentation and documented codebase.
